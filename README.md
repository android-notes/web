### `npm run build` silently fails

It is reported that `npm run build` can fail on machines with no swap space, which is common in cloud environments. If [the symptoms are matching](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/issues/1133#issuecomment-264612171), consider adding some swap space to the machine you’re building on, or build the project locally.

### `npm run build` fails on Heroku

This may be a problem with case sensitive filenames.
Please refer to [this section](#resolving-heroku-deployment-errors).

### Moment.js locales are missing

If you use a [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/), you might notice that only the English locale is available by default. This is because the locale files are large, and you probably only need a subset of [all the locales provided by Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/#multiple-locale-support).

To add a specific Moment.js locale to your bundle, you need to import it explicitly.<br>
For example:

```js
import moment from 'moment';
import 'moment/locale/fr';
```

If import multiple locales this way, you can later switch between them by calling `moment.locale()` with the locale name:

```js
import moment from 'moment';
import 'moment/locale/fr';
import 'moment/locale/es';

// ...

moment.locale('fr');
```

This will only work for locales that have been explicitly imported before.
